/*

Ratings and how they work:

-2: Extremely detrimental
The sort of ability that relegates Pokemon with Uber-level BSTs
into NU.
ex. Slow Start, Truant

-1: Detrimental
An ability that does more harm than good.
ex. Defeatist, Normalize

0: Useless
An ability with no net effect on a Pokemon during a battle.
ex. Pickup, Illuminate

1: Ineffective
An ability that has a minimal effect. Should never be chosen over
any other ability.
ex. Damp, Shell Armor

2: Situationally useful
An ability that can be useful in certain situations.
ex. Blaze, Insomnia

3: Useful
An ability that is generally useful.
ex. Volt Absorb, Iron Fist

4: Very useful
One of the most popular abilities. The difference between 3 and 4
can be ambiguous.
ex. Technician, Protean

5: Essential
The sort of ability that defines metagames.
ex. Drizzle, Shadow Tag
