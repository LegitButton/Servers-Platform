* Custom CSS declarations

* If your server is registered, you can create a file named `custom.css`
* in the `config` directory and populate it with CSS rules to override the
* normal client styles, when the client is connected to your server. In
* other words, you can use this facility to introduce a custom theme for
* your server.
