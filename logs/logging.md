Pokemon Showdown Logging

This is the Pokemon Showdown log directory.

Pokemon Showdown will log rated battles in each format, but not unrated battles. There is currently no config option to log unrated battles. Battle logs are placed under a subdirectory for each month (e.g. 2013-02).

Moderator actions are logged to modlog.txt.

If the server or the simulator process crashes, a stack trace will usually be logged to errors.txt.

By default, Pokemon Showdown does not log the lobby. However, you can enable logging of the lobby by setting the loglobby option in config.js. If you enable lobby logging, lobby logs are written to a subdirectory named lobby.
